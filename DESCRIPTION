Description: A complete analysis pipeline for MALDI-TOF and other
        mass spectrometry data. Distinctive features include baseline
        subtraction methods such as TopHat or SNIP, peak alignment using
        warping functions, handling of replicated measurements as well as
        allowing spectra with different resolutions.
